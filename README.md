# Amazon-E-commerce-Data-Analysis-Apache-Spark-
The objective of this project is to analyze an Amazon dataset to understand its structure, preprocess the data, perform exploratory data analysis, create visualizations, and develop a recommendation system. This project will provide insights into Amazon's e-commerce operations and demonstrate various data analysis techniques.


**1.Dataset Exploration:** Conduct a thorough walkthrough of the dataset to understand its structure, contents, and hierarchy.

**2.Data Preprocessing:** Implement data cleaning and preprocessing techniques to prepare the dataset for analysis, ensuring it is accurate and consistent.

**3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform EDA to identify patterns, trends, and key insights within the data.
**4.Data Visualization:** Create visualizations to effectively communicate findings and facilitate better understanding of the data.




**Results**

Data Preprocessing: Successfully cleaned the dataset, ensuring no missing values in critical columns (user_id, product_id, rating) and correctly casting data types.

**Exploratory Data Analysis:**

Generated summary statistics for the dataset.

Identified patterns in product ratings and categories.

Visualized the distribution of product ratings.
